          <h3>Product Perspective</h3>

<p>Income tax calculation is a very lenthy and complex system. There are many fields and criterias of income, so the
calculation process needs a long time. Generally in Bangladesh, people do the calculation manually. So there is very
much chance of occuring error in calculation. Its also very time consuming and you have to go to bring the forms and
study a lot on them. Our web base software calculates after getting the information and it can be done online.  It’s a
automated process to make the whole income tax calculation. Thus it makes tax payers life easy.</p>

<p>Our product is “iTax” which calculates the income tax of any Bangladeshi individuals or other tax payers (other than company).The main features of this web base software are-</p>

<ol>
<li>Inserts general information and income related information to database.</li>
<li>Calculate income tax.</li>
<li>Fills up a pdf income tax form with given information.</li>
<li>Can print the pdf form.</li>
</ol><p>First a home page is visible to the users. From there, user can login or register. Then he/she has to fill up the form
of general information. After filling all the forms (which comes one after another or you can jump to any form) a pdf
form automatically open and it is filled up by which information you gave in the previous fields. That page will
contain the total payable tax also. </p>
